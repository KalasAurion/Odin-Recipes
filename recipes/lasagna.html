            <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 lb dry lasagna noodles (9 unbroken)</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>24 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
            <li>4 ounces parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. This will be for
                the pasta. Prepare the sauce (next step) while the water is 
                coming to boil.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil on medium-high heat in a large skillet.
                Add the ground beef and cook until lightly browned on all
                sides. Remove the beef from the heat and reserve 1 Tbsp of
                fat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet and 
                cook for around 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook 
                30 seconds.Return the cooked beef to the skillet and cook 
                for around 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the contents of the skillet to a medium-sized pot.
                Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to
                the pot. Add the parsley, oregano, and other italian herbs,
                adjusting to taste. Sprinkle the pinch of garlic powder to 
                taste. Add red wine vinegar and sugar, adjusting sugar to 
                taste as needed. Add salt and bring to a simmer. Once simmering
                lower heat to maintain a simmer. Cook for 20-40 minutes,
                stirring often so nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot.
                Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the dry noodles to the boiling water from step 1 and cook 
                them per package directions. Stir often to prevent from sticking.
                Drain into a colander and rinse with cool water, gently seperating
                noodles that are stuck together. Spread a small amount of olive 
                oil on a large rimmed baking sheet and lay out the cooked noodles,
                turning them over so that they get coated on both sides with oil.
                This will keep them from sticking together.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>In a 9 x 13 in casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and 
                spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of noodles 
                lenghtwise over the sauce. Ladle more sauce over the noodles. Sprinkle
                a layer (about 1/3) of the mozzarella over the sauce. Add half of the 
                ricotta cheese; sprinkle half of the grated parmesan cheese over the 
                top of the ricotta. Add a second layer of noodles and top it with half
                of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the rest
                of the ricotta cheese, and the rest of the parmesan. Finish with another
                layer of noodles and spread the remaining sauce over them; top with the 
                remaining mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminium, tented slightly, and back for 45 minutes.
                Uncover during the last 5 minutes to brown the cheese and edges slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving</li>
        </ol>
