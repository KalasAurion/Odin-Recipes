        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and chop potatoes into 1 inch (approximate) cubes</li>
            <li>Place the chopped potatoes into a large pot filled with water.
                Bring the water to a boil and cook for around 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>In a large walled skillet on medium heat, begin browning the meat,
                around 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>While the meat is cooking, finely chop the thyme and rosemary and
                mince the garlic.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Once the meat is browned, drain as much fat/juice as possible.
                Keep the grease to a minimum. Grate the onion and carrot into 
                the meat, stir and cook for about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste, garlic, Worcestershire suace and cook
                for about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Add the red wine, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Let this
                cook down for around 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock and let this cook down for about 15 minutes. 
                Reduce the volume by about 50%.
            </li>
            <li>While the mince is reducing, check the potatoes with a fork for 
                doneness.Drain and place in a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Mash the potatoes, then add the eggs and butter. Add milk in slowly
                until a smooth consistency is achieved.
            </li>
            <li>Mix in about 4 ounces of the grated parmesan. Add salt and pepper 
                to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Once the meat mince has reduced, place it in a large casserole dish. 
                With a spatula, spread the potato mash evenly over the mince. Use a 
                fork to break up the smoothness and create peaks and valleys in the 
                mash. Top with the remaining parmesan.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the mash is a beautiful 
                golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 5 
                minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
